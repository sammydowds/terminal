# Terminal

## Summary
Terminal is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate the creation of chat-like interfaces. It enables users to chunk documents into a vector database, allowing for efficient retrieval of relevant information based on user queries. The system is driven by a frontend that interacts with user-created agents to generate contextually appropriate responses, enhancing the overall user experience.
